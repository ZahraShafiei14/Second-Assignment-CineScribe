# Movie Aggregator app üé¨

This is my first project, which is a Movie Aggregator application 
implemented in Java, utilizing APIs to gather information about 
movies and actors from various sources. It allows users to search 
about movies and actors and discover their information.


## Description üìÉ
* You can search for the movie's title to discover provided information about each movie,
including plot summary, cast, release date, ratings, writers, directors and more.
* You can also get information about actors such as their net worth, nationality, birthday, etc.

## Getting Started üöÄ
The development of the Movie Aggregator program,
which is actually my first java program this semester,
involved several key steps, including:
1. Obtaining API keys from the mentioned websites.
2. Using Object Mapper to handle JSON date. This is an example of JSON date:
```json
